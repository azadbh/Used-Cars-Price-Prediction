# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various factors such as car brand, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models, we build an accurate regression model to estimate car prices.
